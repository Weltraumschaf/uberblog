## Unit test Your Cocoa Application with GHUnit

In the last years I have good experiences with [Unit testing][1]. It gives you more safety that your software meets your behavioral requirements. So I searched for some frameworks to make tests for my Cocoa application. I found [GHUnit][2]. A preoject started by [Gabriel Handford][3]. The source is available on [GitHub][4].
