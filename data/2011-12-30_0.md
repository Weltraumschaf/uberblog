## Only SSL access to my blog

Some time ago I configured my blog to serve both HTTP and HTTPS. From now on I will redirect all non-SSL requests permanently to HTTPS. The reason is that no one access the login page without SSL by accident. If you encounter any problems please let me know.

Unless you have installed the [CAcert][1] root certificates in your browser, you will become a warning about my serverâ€™s certificate. To prevent this install the root certificates from [here][2].
