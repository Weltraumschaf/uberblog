## Some Words About Me

<img src="../img/ich.jpg" width="130" style="float:left; padding: 10px 35px 15px 10px;"/> My name is Sven Strittmatter and I'm a software engineer home based in [Stuttgart (Germany)][1]. 2005 I've graduated as [Diplom-Ingenieur][2] for information technology at [Duale Hochschule Stuttgart][3].

As part of practical education for my studies I was employed at the [Fraunhofer IPA][4] in the departments for "production and automation engineering" and "facility layout and logistics planing". Here I got in touch with large scaled projects and supported them with software tools.

After working one year as a junior software developer for [milesoft][5] I switched to [Webix Solutions GmbH][6] and developed communities for magazines based on the [Interred CMS][7] for nearly three years (for example [Freundin][8], [Elle][9], and [AMS][10]). At Webix I also got in touch with the work of an junior project manager and evolved to a senior software developer. As senior software developer I was responsible for the education and evolving of the junior developers.

Late in 2009 I began a new opportunity as QA manager at [KWICK! Community][11]. At KWICK! I was responsible for the adoption of unit testing, continuous integration, and agile methodologies for improving the whole software development process and product quality.
