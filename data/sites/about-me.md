<img src="../img/ich.jpg" width="130" style="float:left; padding: 5px 25px 35px 0;"/> My name is Sven Strittmatter and I'm a software engineer home based in [Stuttgart (Germany)][1]. 2005 I've graduated as [Diplom-Ingenieur][2] for information technology at [Duale Hochschule Stuttgart][3].

As part of practical education for my studies I was employed at the [Fraunhofer IPA][4] in the departments for "production and automation engineering" and "facility layout and logistics planing".
