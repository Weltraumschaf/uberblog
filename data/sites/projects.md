## Projects

Things I've coded in my live.

### Darcs Plugin for Jenkins

At one of my [employers][1] [Darcs][2] was in use as [VCS][3]. For it's age it is a really cool [DVCS][4]. One big disadvantage is lack of tool support. There was [no plugin][5] to integrate Darcs into [Jenkins CI][6]. So I decided to make a [Darcs plugin][7].

### KAPIT
[KAPIT][9] is the [KWICK! API Test-Tool][10]. I've built this small web based tool for playing around with KWICK! Social Platform API. With KAPIT you can try out the API very easy without coding.

### Websites

[Lugagne.de][11] is a website I've made for my former neighbor, where he publishes his work as film editor. [oa-vs.de][12] is the website I've made for a friend, who works in the event organization/service area.

### Old stuff

Old stuff mostly build just for fun is hosted [here][8].
