## Projects

Things I've coded in my live.

### Darcs Plugin for Jenkins

At one of my [employers][1] [Darcs][2] was in use as [VCS][3]. For it's age it is a really cool [DVCS][4]. One big disadvantage is lack of tool support. There was [no plugin][5] to integrate Darcs into [Jenkins CI][6]. So I decided to make a [Darcs plugin][7].

### Old stuff

Old stuff mostly build just for fun is hosted [here][8].
