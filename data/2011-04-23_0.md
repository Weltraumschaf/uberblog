## Launched Website for a Video Cutter

Some days ago I launched a new [website][1]. It’s the portfolio of my former neighbor. He’s a talented digital video cutter allways searching for new interesting projects to work on near Stuttgart in Germany. For this website I used first time the [Sublime][2] video player. Very nice tool. Easy to integrate and with powerfull JavaScript API. The player supports HTML5 video tag but also provides a Flash fallback for browser which did not support HTML5 or a propper codec.
