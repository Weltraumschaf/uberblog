## NinjaUI jQuery UI library

Just playing around with [NinjaUI][1] for a private project. It’s a nice stylish UI plugin for [jQuery][2]. It’s not that large and complex than [jQuery UI][3]. It has less feature and options but in my opinion the better UI design. One of the unique features are the symbols realized with webfonts. Take a look at it, but beware it’s still beta.
