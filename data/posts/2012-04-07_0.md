## Passenger On Board

In my first approach I were running the [Sinatra][1] app for the [REST][2] API of my blog (for ratings etc.) from command line. This has the drawback that the HTTP daemon integrated in Sinatra listens on a different port than the rest of the blog. This leads to same origin problems with ajaxing the REST API. To circumvent this I've used a [small proxy script][3] as a workaround. But now I've found [Passenger][4] (aka. [mod_ruby][5]) and migrated my blog to that. The static content is still served as static content via Apache. But the Sinatra app runs know via Apache, too. Passenger is the [Rack][6] implementation for Apache or Nginx.
