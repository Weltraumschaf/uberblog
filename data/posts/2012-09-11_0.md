## Agile Bodensee Conference 2012

My [brother][1] has organized his first conference. It is also the first 
local agile conference at [Bodensee in Germany][2]. It is the [Agile Bodensee][3]
on 28th of September.

One of my favorite highlite is the fact that the conference fee is really cheap. 
The fee for the whole day is only 50 Bugs. Other highlights are the keynote speakers:
[Jurgen Appelo][4] and [Joseph Pelrine][5].
