## Maven And Arbitrary Jar Files

Since Iâ€™m coding sometimes with Java I also use [Maven][1] to manage dependencies. It is a very easy and straight forward approach to use Maven. Also very nice that [Netbeans][2] just opens a POM file. No need to configure a project or such.

But now I was confronted with the need to include a library which is only available as stand alone jar file. The solution is to install the jar file into your local Maven repository as described [here][3].
