## Debian and the outdated Ruby Gems

[Debian][1] is in my personal opinion the best Linux server distribution ever! I've never used something else. But one big drawback is that a lot of stuff is really outdated: With PHP you have to use backports. Java and Maven brings some hassle, too. And now I realized the same problem with Ruby Gems. But there is a solution as described [here][2] (german blog post).

By default Debian disables the <kbd>gem update --system</kbd> to prevent circumventing the Debian packet management system. If you need a newer Gem version you can install the [rubygems-update][3]:

	$ sudo gem install rubygems-update --version=1.8.20

With the --version option you can chose your preferred version. After installation you need to invoke the update command:

	$ sudo update_rubygems
