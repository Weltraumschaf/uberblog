## Chrome Dev Tools Reloaded 

Are you using [Firebug][1] or [Venkman][2]? Did you ever tried the Chrome developer tools? If your answers were yes and no you should watch this video from Google IO 2011 about the Chrome developer tools:

If your answers were no and no you should consider watching the video, too. And you should think about better ways than sprinkling <kbd>alert()</kbd> all over you're code and forget them there for the joy of the user. 

The CSS3 patterns mentioned in the video you can find [here][3].
