## Writing Compilers and Interpreters: A Software Engineering Approach

I have bought a [Book][1] from [Ronald Mak][2] about how to write compilers and interpreters. Interesting approach is the software design view: How to specify and implement the modules/components language independent as possible. This book is a good extension to the book [Language Implementation Patterns][3] from Terence Parr. The code I produce during my lessons you can see on [GitHub][4].
