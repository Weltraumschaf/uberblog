## Hudson vs. Jenkins

Do you remember [Hudson CI][1]? If you did some [CI][2] two years ago then you know Hudson and you also know that after the acquisition of Sun by Oracle there was hassle in the comunity. End of story was that the lead developer [Khosuke][3] and some of his fellows spinned of the [Jenkins][4] project. That's the short version. For the longer one ask the search engine of your choice. 

But one import issue for newbies to CI is the question: Which project should we use? If you see the numbers the answer is quite clear:
