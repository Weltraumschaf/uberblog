## Recomened Books for learning Objective-C and Cocoa

Since some time I keep busy with learning [Objective-C][1] to program on my Mac. There are several good resources in the web. But I like to read books. So I find a very good book to learn the concepts ob Objective-C. It's [Programming in Objective-C][2] from Stephen G. Kocham. If you go further with programming on a Mac you will reach something called [Cocoa][3] (pronounced [ko:ko:]). It's some thing like a rich framework (in deed there are several) which makes it easy to you to program nice (desktop) applications. This is the hardest part because Cocoa covers a very large and powerful API. I found two books dealing with this subject: [Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X][4] from Aaron Hillegass and [Cocoa Design Patterns][5] from Erik M. Buck and Donald A. Yacktman.
