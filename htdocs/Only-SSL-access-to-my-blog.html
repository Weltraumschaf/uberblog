<p>Some time ago I configured my blog to serve both HTTP and HTTPS. From now on I will redirect all non-SSL requests permanently to HTTPS. The reason is that no one access the login page without SSL by accident. If you encounter any problems please let me know.</p>

<p>Unless you have installed the <a href="http://www.cacert.org/">CAcert</a> root certificates in your browser, you will become a warning about my serverâ€™s certificate. To prevent this install the root certificates from <a href="http://www.cacert.org/index.php?id=3">here</a>.</p>
