<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/mimssbits/27581/?nlid=nldly&amp;nld=2012-02-16">Christopher Mims complains about the fact that a website is treating him with his iPad as a second class citicen</a>. He’s right that web developers shouldn’t do that. But he’s arguing that he don’t want to download the offered iPad-App because in his opion this is antisocial doing that on a low bandwith public wifi. Is it better to watch a video over that low bandwith public wifi?</p>

<p>And more important: I wanted to give him this feedback on his blog. But I have to register to do that. Hey Chris, don’t bother me with this stupid registration stuff. I don’t wanna register on technologyreview.com to leave one comment. You’re patronizing me in the same way ;)</p>
