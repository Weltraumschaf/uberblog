<p>Since Iâ€™m coding sometimes with Java I also use <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> to manage dependencies. It is a very easy and straight forward approach to use Maven. Also very nice that <a href="http://netbeans.org/">Netbeans</a> just opens a POM file. No need to configure a project or such.</p>

<p>But now I was confronted with the need to include a library which is only available as stand alone jar file. The solution is to install the jar file into your local Maven repository as described <a href="http://www.zparacha.com/include-externaljar-file-in-maven/">here</a>.</p>
