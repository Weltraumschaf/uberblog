# Uberblog

Because Wordpress and PHP sucks so much I decided to use a way simpler
approach for my blog: A git repo with a bunch of Markdown files and
a view lines Ruby code which generates static html files, RSS feed
and a sitemap.xml.

## Layout
The layout is oriented by the the default theme from Wordpres.
Credits to the Wordpress theme team. See license for the header
images [Wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org).

The RSS feed icon is from [Mr. Icons](http://www.mricons.com)
shared unter Creative Commons.

All other stuff made by me (Weltraumschaf) is under the
[Beer Ware License](http://www.weltraumschaf.de/the-beer-ware-license.txt).

## Todo

- generate suffixed output files if duplicate (on blogposts with same title)
- better error handling on wrong paramters on cli
